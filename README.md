# obsidian-web-mcp

A secure, remote-accessible MCP server that gives LLMs read/write access to your Obsidian vault from anywhere -- your desktop, your phone, a hotel Wi-Fi network. Unlike local-only Obsidian MCP servers, this one runs over HTTPS with real authentication, so Claude (or any MCP client) can reach your vault whether you're at your desk or not.

It reads and writes markdown files on disk, parses YAML frontmatter, maintains an in-memory frontmatter index for fast queries, and handles full-text search -- all behind OAuth 2.0 authentication and a Cloudflare Tunnel that never exposes your machine directly to the internet.

## Why This Exists

There are many Obsidian MCP servers. Most are local stdio servers -- they work when Claude Code is running on the same machine as your vault. That's useful, but it means:

- **Claude.ai (web) can't reach your vault.** The browser-based Claude has no way to connect to a local stdio server.
- **Claude on your phone can't reach your vault.** Same problem.
- **If you use Obsidian Sync, local MCP servers can corrupt files.** Non-atomic writes create partial files that Sync propagates to every device.

This server solves all three. It runs as a persistent HTTP service on the machine where your vault lives, tunneled securely through Cloudflare, and authenticates via OAuth 2.0 -- the same protocol Claude uses for Gmail, Google Calendar, and other integrations. The result: your vault becomes a first-class MCP connector available everywhere Claude is.

## Architecture

                                                            +------+-------+

                                                            |  mobile)     |
                                                            +--------------+
```

Your vault files never leave your machine. Cloudflare Tunnel creates an outbound-only connection from your server to Cloudflare's edge -- no inbound ports opened, no public IP exposed, no port forwarding. Claude connects to the Cloudflare edge, which relays requests through the tunnel to your server.

Obsidian and the MCP server both operate on the same directory of markdown files. The server uses atomic writes (write-to-temp-then-rename) so Obsidian Sync and the server never conflict.

## Security Model

This is a server that provides network access to your personal notes. Security is not optional.

**A human logs in before any client is authorized.** Connecting a client uses the OAuth 2.0 authorization-code + PKCE flow, which opens a browser at `/oauth/authorize`. There, you must sign in with `VAULT_OAUTH_USERNAME` / `VAULT_OAUTH_PASSWORD` before the server issues an authorization code -- the password is required on every authorization. Every subsequent MCP tool call is then validated against a bearer token. No authorization code is issued to an unauthenticated visitor, and no request reaches a tool function without a valid token. **If `VAULT_OAUTH_PASSWORD` is not set, the server fails closed and refuses to authorize anyone** -- there is no anonymous auto-approve.

**Your vault is never exposed directly to the internet.** The recommended deployment uses a Cloudflare Tunnel -- an outbound-only encrypted connection. Your machine opens no inbound ports, and the server itself binds to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) by default. The login above is the authentication boundary; you can additionally layer Cloudflare Access (SSO, device posture, IP restrictions) on top for defense in depth.

**Path traversal is blocked at the filesystem layer.** Every file operation resolves paths against the vault root directory and rejects any attempt to escape it -- `..` traversal, symlink following, null byte injection, and dotfile access (`.obsidian`, `.git`, `.trash`) are all caught before they reach the filesystem. The server will never read or write outside your vault directory.

**Writes are atomic.** Every file write goes to a temporary file first, then atomically replaces the target via `os.replace()`. This guarantees that neither Obsidian nor Obsidian Sync ever sees a partially-written file -- the operation either completes fully or doesn't happen at all.

**Safety limits prevent abuse.** Writes are capped at 1MB per file, batch operations at 20 files per request, and search results at 50 matches. Deletions are soft -- files move to `.trash/` rather than being permanently removed, matching Obsidian's own behavior. The delete tool also requires an explicit `confirm=true` parameter as a safety gate.

## Reporting Security Issues

Found a vulnerability? Please report it privately rather than opening a public issue or pull request. This repository has [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/jimprosser/obsidian-web-mcp/security/advisories) enabled: open the repo's **Security** tab and click **Report a vulnerability**. I'll acknowledge the report, coordinate a fix, and credit you in the resulting advisory. Please hold public disclosure until a patch is available.

## Tools

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- An Obsidian vault (any directory of markdown files)
- [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) (only needed for remote access)
- A domain managed by Cloudflare (only needed for remote access)

## Quick Start

### Local development

```bash
# Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/jimprosser/obsidian-web-mcp.git
cd obsidian-web-mcp

# Generate the MCP bearer token
export VAULT_MCP_TOKEN=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")

# Set the login the OAuth browser step requires. REQUIRED -- without a password
# the server fails closed and refuses to authorize any client.
export VAULT_OAUTH_USERNAME="you"
export VAULT_OAUTH_PASSWORD="$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(24))")"   # or a passphrase you'll remember

# Point at your vault
export VAULT_PATH="$HOME/Obsidian/MyVault"

# Run the server
uv run vault-mcp
```

The server starts on port 8420 by default and serves MCP over Streamable HTTP at `/` (the root path — MCP clients connect to the base URL directly). It binds to `127.0.0.1` -- reachable locally and through a Cloudflare Tunnel, but not exposed on your LAN. Set `VAULT_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0` only if you deliberately want direct network exposure.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VAULT_PATH` | Yes | `~/Obsidian/MyVault` | Absolute path to your Obsidian vault directory |
| `VAULT_MCP_TOKEN` | Yes | (none) | 256-bit bearer token validated on every MCP request |
| `VAULT_OAUTH_PASSWORD` | **Yes** | (none) | Password for the interactive login at `/oauth/authorize`. **If unset, the server refuses to authorize any client (fail-closed).** |
| `VAULT_OAUTH_USERNAME` | No | `obsidian` | Username for the interactive login |
| `VAULT_MCP_HOST` | No | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Loopback by default; set `0.0.0.0` only for deliberate LAN exposure |
| `VAULT_MCP_PORT` | No | `8420` | Port the HTTP server listens on |
| `VAULT_MCP_PATH` | No | `/` | HTTP path the MCP transport mounts at. Default `/` keeps connector interop (#19) byte-identical. Set to a prefix like `/mcp` to host the server alongside other services on one hostname behind a reverse proxy that can't rewrite paths. **Validated at startup:** must be absolute and must not collide with an auth-exempt route (`/health`, `/oauth/*`, `/.well-known/*`), or the server refuses to start (fail-closed) rather than serve the vault on an unauthenticated path. |
| `VAULT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | No | (none) | Comma-separated hostnames allowed through the MCP library's DNS-rebinding protection, **appended** to the loopback defaults (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]`). Set this to your tunnel/proxy hostname (e.g. `vault-mcp.yourdomain.com`) for any remote deployment, otherwise requests carrying that `Host` are rejected. |
| `VAULT_MCP_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` | No | `127.0.0.1` | Client IPs uvicorn trusts to set `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Loopback-only by default, because a trusted Cloudflare Tunnel / Caddy proxy connects over localhost. **Never set this to `*`** -- that lets any caller spoof the advertised OAuth origin via `X-Forwarded-Host`. Set to `::1` if your proxy connects over IPv6 loopback. |
| `VAULT_MCP_PUBLIC_URL` | No | (none) | Canonical public origin (e.g. `https://vault-mcp.yourdomain.com`) for every URL the server advertises -- the OAuth discovery metadata and the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge. When set it **pins** those URLs so a spoofed `Host` / `X-Forwarded-Host` header cannot redirect OAuth discovery to an attacker. When unset, the per-request base URL is used. Recommended for any reverse-proxy deployment. |
| `VAULT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | No | `vault-mcp-client` | Client ID for the headless `client_credentials` grant |
| `VAULT_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | (none) | Only required for the headless `client_credentials` grant. The Claude/ChatGPT browser flow uses dynamic client registration and does **not** need this. |
| `VAULT_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URIS` | No | (none) | Comma-separated allowlist of redirect URIs for the static `VAULT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` when using the browser flow. Dynamically-registered clients (Claude/ChatGPT) carry their own; leave unset unless you connect a static client through `/oauth/authorize`. |
| `VAULT_DAILY_NOTES_FOLDER` | No | (none) | Folder for the daily-note tools; empty means the vault root |
| `VAULT_DAILY_NOTES_FORMAT` | No | `%Y-%m-%d` | `strftime` pattern for the daily-note filename |
| `VAULT_DAILY_NOTES_TEMPLATE` | No | (none) | `strftime` template prepended when a daily note is first created |
| `VAULT_MCP_HEARTBEAT_URL` | No | (none) | Optional push URL for an uptime monitor (Uptime Kuma, Healthchecks.io, ...). When set, a daemon thread GETs it on an interval. Must be `http(s)`; redirects are not followed and the URL is treated as a secret (never logged in full). Empty = disabled. |
| `VAULT_MCP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` | No | `60` | Seconds between heartbeat pings. Must be a positive integer; a bad value fails closed at startup. Only used when `VAULT_MCP_HEARTBEAT_URL` is set. |
| `VAULT_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` | No | (none) | Append-only JSONL audit log of vault mutations. When set, every mutation appends one record; empty disables auditing. The raw bearer token is never written -- only its SHA-256 hash. Must resolve **outside** the vault and be writable; otherwise the server **fails closed** at startup. See [Audit logging](#audit-logging). |
| `VAULT_AUDIT_LOG_INCLUDE_READS` | No | `false` | Also record read/search operations (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`). Off by default; mutations are always logged once the audit log is enabled. |

Generate secrets with: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`

## Audit logging

Set `VAULT_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` to a file path to record every vault mutation as an append-only
JSON line. Auditing is **off by default**; with no path set there is no overhead. Reads and
searches are logged too when `VAULT_AUDIT_LOG_INCLUDE_READS` is on (off by default, since
reads are high-volume).

Each record carries: `timestamp` (UTC), `token_id_hash` (SHA-256 of the bearer token -- the
raw token is never written), `client_id` (a best-effort User-Agent hint), `operation`,
`target_path`, `size_before`/`size_after`, `checksum_before`/`checksum_after` (SHA-256),
`request_id`, `operation_status`, and `error`. Example line:

```json
{"checksum_after":"9f86d0…","checksum_before":null,"client_id":"claude","error":null,"operation":"vault_write","operation_status":"success","request_id":"a1b2…","size_after":42,"size_before":null,"target_path":"notes/today.md","timestamp":"2026-06-14T18:30:00+00:00","token_id_hash":"5e88…"}
```

**Put the log outside the vault.** `VAULT_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` must resolve outside `VAULT_PATH`.
A log inside the vault would be just another file the vault tools can reach, so an
authenticated caller could overwrite it (`vault_write`) or move it (`vault_delete`) and
defeat the append-only premise. The server validates this at startup and **refuses to start
(fail-closed)** if the path is not writable or resolves inside the vault.

**Threat model — the log is best-effort at runtime, not tamper-evident.** A write failure
at runtime is logged to the server log but never alters the tool result (the audit trail
must not be able to break a write), so a record can be dropped silently; the server log is
the only signal. Batch mutations emit one record per file with that file's own status, so a
partial failure is never recorded as a whole-batch success. The unauthenticated `GET /health`
endpoint reports only `{"status": "ok", "audit": {"enabled": <bool>}}` — it deliberately does
not expose the log path or write counters (which would leak host filesystem layout and a
vault-activity side-channel to anonymous callers over the tunnel).

## Connecting to Claude

The Claude desktop and mobile apps can connect to remote MCP servers via OAuth.

1. Start the server (locally or behind a tunnel)
2. Open Claude and go to **Settings > Integrations > Add Integration**
3. Enter your server URL (e.g. `https://vault-mcp.yourdomain.com`)
4. Claude registers automatically (dynamic client registration) and discovers the OAuth endpoints
5. Claude opens a browser window at the server's `/oauth/authorize`
6. **Sign in** with your `VAULT_OAUTH_USERNAME` / `VAULT_OAUTH_PASSWORD`; the server then issues the authorization and redirects back
7. Claude now has access to all nine vault tools -- on desktop and mobile

For local-only use (no tunnel), point Claude at `http://localhost:8420`.

## Remote Access with Cloudflare Tunnel

To make the server accessible from anywhere:

```bash
# Install cloudflared
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared

# Set your desired hostname and run the interactive setup
export VAULT_MCP_HOSTNAME="vault-mcp.yourdomain.com"
./scripts/setup-tunnel.sh
```

The script authenticates with Cloudflare, creates a tunnel, writes the config, and sets up the DNS record. You will need a domain managed by Cloudflare.

After setup, allow your tunnel hostname through the MCP library's DNS rebinding protection by setting `VAULT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated; appended to the loopback defaults, so no source edit is needed):

```bash
export VAULT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS="vault-mcp.yourdomain.com"
```

## Production Deployment (macOS)

For always-on operation, use launchd to run both the MCP server and the Cloudflare Tunnel as persistent background services that start at login and restart on failure.

### 1. Edit the plist templates

```bash
cp scripts/launchd/com.example.vault-mcp.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
cp scripts/launchd/com.example.cloudflared-vault.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
```

Open each plist and replace the placeholder tokens:
- `REPLACE_WITH_UV_PATH` -- path to `uv` binary (run `which uv`)
- `REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_PATH` -- absolute path to this project directory
- `REPLACE_WITH_VAULT_PATH` -- absolute path to your Obsidian vault
- `REPLACE_WITH_TOKEN` -- your `VAULT_MCP_TOKEN` value
- `REPLACE_WITH_OAUTH_USERNAME` -- the login username you want (e.g. your name)
- `REPLACE_WITH_OAUTH_PASSWORD` -- your `VAULT_OAUTH_PASSWORD` value (required; the server refuses to authorize without it)
- `REPLACE_WITH_HOME` -- your home directory (e.g. `/Users/yourname`)
- `REPLACE_WITH_CLOUDFLARED_PATH` -- path to `cloudflared` binary (run `which cloudflared`)

**Remote deployments (tunnel or VPS):** a launchd service does not inherit shell `export`s, so the `VAULT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` you set in the Tunnel section above must be added directly to the plist's `EnvironmentVariables` dict — otherwise DNS-rebinding protection rejects your public hostname. Add your hostname (and, recommended, pin the advertised origin):

```xml
<key>VAULT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS</key>
<string>vault-mcp.yourdomain.com</string>
<key>VAULT_MCP_PUBLIC_URL</key>
<string>https://vault-mcp.yourdomain.com</string>
```

### 2. Load the services

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.vault-mcp.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.cloudflared-vault.plist
```

Both services are configured with `RunAtLoad` (start at login) and `KeepAlive` (restart on failure). They will survive reboots.

### 3. Verify

```bash
# Check both services are running
launchctl list | grep vault

# Test the server responds
curl -s http://localhost:8420/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server

# Check logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/vault-mcp-error.log
```

## Obsidian Sync Compatibility

The server coexists with Obsidian Sync (or any file-based sync mechanism) without conflict. All writes use atomic file replacement (`write-to-temp-then-rename`), which means:

- Obsidian never sees a half-written file
- If Sync and the MCP server write to the same file simultaneously, the last write wins (standard filesystem semantics) but neither write is corrupted
- The frontmatter index watches for filesystem changes via `watchdog` and updates automatically when Sync brings in new files

## Development

### Running tests

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest tests/ -v
```

(`pytest` lives in the optional `dev` extra, so the `--extra dev` flag is what installs and runs it.) Tests use temporary directories and never touch your real vault.

### Extending the server

You can add your own tools, HTTP routes, and index hooks **without forking `server.py`**.
Subclass `extensions.Extension` (every hook is a no-op by default, so override only what
you need) and run the server with `serve([YourExtension()])` from your own entry point:

```python
from obsidian_vault_mcp.server import serve
from obsidian_vault_mcp.extensions import Extension
from obsidian_vault_mcp.write_events import register_write_listener


class MyExtension(Extension):
    def register_tools(self, mcp):
        # add @mcp.tool tools BEFORE the app/tool schema is built
        ...

    def before_indexes_start(self, frontmatter_index):
        # e.g. attach a change listener so no change is missed once the index starts
        frontmatter_index.add_change_listener(self._on_change)
        # ...or react to a mutation as an operation (see write-event seam below)
        register_write_listener(self._on_write)  # _on_write(operation, paths)

    def after_indexes_start(self, frontmatter_index):
        # e.g. start a periodic reconcile loop now that the index is live
        ...

    def register_routes(self, app):
        # add Starlette routes (bearer-protected like the rest of the surface)
        ...

    def shutdown(self):
        # released at process exit (registered via atexit)
        ...


def main():
    serve([MyExtension()])
```

The hooks run in the order above.

> **Trust model — read this.** Extensions are **fully-trusted, in-process code** that you
> choose to load. An extension runs with the server's full privileges: it can read the
> bearer token and OAuth secrets, read/write your vault, and mutate any route. This is
> **not a sandbox** — only load extensions you wrote or trust, like any dependency.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Extension routes are authenticated, with a footgun guard.** Routes are registered
  before the bearer-auth middleware, so they require the bearer token like every other
  route. As a guardrail against honest mistakes, `build_app()` **fails closed** if an
  extension adds a route that would cover an auth-exempt path (`/health`, `/oauth/*`,
  `/.well-known/*`, or the off-root `GET/HEAD /` probe) — including via a wildcard
  pattern — and rejects extension `Mount`s and `WebSocketRoute`s outright. This catches
  accidents; it is **not** a boundary against a hostile extension (which, running
  in-process, could bypass it anyway — see the trust model above).
- **The stock server is unaffected.** With no extensions, `serve()` behaves exactly like
  the previous `main()`; `FrontmatterIndex` change listeners and write listeners are a no-op
  with none registered.
- **Write listeners see mutations as operations.** Where `add_change_listener` is watcher-driven
  (`(abs_path, exists)`, `.md` only, can't tell a tool write from an external edit),
  `write_events.register_write_listener(cb)` fires `cb(operation, paths)` once per successful
  mutation from the core write tools — `operation` is `"created"`/`"updated"`/`"moved"`/`"deleted"`,
  a move passes `[source, destination]`, a batch passes only the paths it wrote. The publish
  side, `fire_write(operation, paths)`, is public so an extension that writes on its own path
  can join the same stream. Use it for a provenance-aware commit, an audit log, or a webhook;
  a listener's exception is logged and swallowed.

## VPS Setup With Cloudflare Origin TLS + Caddy Reverse Proxy

This is an alternative to the Cloudflare Tunnel flow above. In this setup, the MCP server runs on a VPS, Cloudflare proxies a public hostname such as `your-mcp-server.dev`, Caddy terminates TLS with a Cloudflare Origin Certificate, and Caddy reverse-proxies requests to the local MCP server on `VAULT_MCP_PORT`. No Cloudflare Tunnel is required.

These steps assume Ubuntu 24.04 on the VPS. Expose only ports `80` and `443` publicly. Do not open `VAULT_MCP_PORT` to the internet.

### 1. Prepare the VPS

- Point `your-mcp-server.dev` at your VPS in Cloudflare DNS
- Turn on the Cloudflare proxy for that record (orange cloud)
- In the Cloudflare dashboard, set **SSL/TLS** mode to **Full (Strict)**

### 2. Install Caddy

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring curl

curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg

curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y caddy
caddy version
```

### 3. Create and install a Cloudflare Origin Certificate

Generate the certificate in the Cloudflare dashboard under **SSL/TLS > Origin Server > Create Certificate**.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/your-mcp-server/tls
sudo cp cert.pem key.pem /etc/your-mcp-server/tls/
sudo chmod 750 /etc/your-mcp-server/tls
sudo chmod 640 /etc/your-mcp-server/tls/cert.pem
sudo chmod 600 /etc/your-mcp-server/tls/key.pem
```

### 4. Configure Caddy

Edit `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

```caddyfile
your-mcp-server.dev {
    tls /etc/your-mcp-server/tls/cert.pem /etc/your-mcp-server/tls/key.pem
    reverse_proxy localhost:8420
}

:80 {
    redir https://{host}{uri}
}
```

If you use a different local port, replace `8420` with the value you set for `VAULT_MCP_PORT`.

Apply the config and verify Caddy is healthy:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart caddy
sudo systemctl status caddy --no-pager
```

Live logs:

```bash
journalctl -u caddy -f

### 5. Allow the public hostname in the server

The MCP library enables DNS rebinding protection, so set `VAULT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to your public hostname (comma-separated; appended to the loopback defaults — no need to edit the source):

```bash
export VAULT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS="your-mcp-server.dev"
```

Caddy reverse-proxies from `localhost`, so the loopback-only `VAULT_MCP_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` default already trusts its `X-Forwarded-*` headers — no change needed. As defense in depth, pin the origin the server advertises in OAuth discovery so a spoofed `X-Forwarded-Host` can never redirect it:

```bash
export VAULT_MCP_PUBLIC_URL="https://your-mcp-server.dev"
```

### 6. Start obsidian-web-mcp on the VPS

Use the same environment variables described in [Configuration](#configuration), then start the server on the local port Caddy proxies to:

```bash
export VAULT_MCP_PORT=8420
uv run vault-mcp
```

If you run the service under `systemd`, keep `VAULT_MCP_PORT` aligned with the `reverse_proxy` target in the Caddyfile.

### 7. Verify the deployment

From the VPS, confirm the local server is responding:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8420/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

Then confirm the public HTTPS endpoint works through Cloudflare and Caddy:

```bash
curl -I https://your-mcp-server.dev
curl -s https://your-mcp-server.dev/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

When you add the integration in Claude, use `https://your-mcp-server.dev` as the server URL.
